# Hi! I'm Håvard (Howard0000) 👋  
[:norway: Norsk versjon](README.md)

Project manager in the construction industry by day – developer and problem solver by night.  
I like working in small, safe steps: many commits, well-documented code, and solutions that actually work in practice.

💡 **Focus areas:**  
- Smart home (Home Assistant, integrations, automations)  
- Networking and infrastructure (Raspberry Pi, VPN, Pi-hole, UniFi)  
- Integrations with APIs and third-party systems  
- Documentation and sharing projects so others can reuse them  

🔧 **Technologies I often use:**  
Python · YAML · Docker · Node-RED · iptables/iproute2 · Modbus · REST API

## 🛠 How I work

- Focus on **good documentation**, simple solutions, and safe defaults.  
- I prefer small, clear commits over big “all-in-one” changes.  
- Code and README files are often **proofread and polished with AI**, but all changes are reviewed and tested manually.  
- The goal is always: solutions that are **robust, understandable, and easy to maintain**.
