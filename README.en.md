# Hi! I'm HÃ¥vard (Howard0000) ðŸ‘‹  
[:norway: Norsk versjon](README.md)

Project manager in the construction industry by day â€“ developer and problem solver in my spare time.  
I like to work in small, safe steps: many commits, well-documented code, and solutions that actually work in practice.  

ðŸ’¡ **Focus areas:**  
- Smart home (Home Assistant, integrations, automations)  
- Networking and infrastructure (Raspberry Pi, VPN, Pi-hole, UniFi)  
- Integrations with APIs and third-party devices  
- Documentation and sharing of projects so others can reuse them  

ðŸ”§ **Technologies I often use:**  
Python Â· YAML Â· Docker Â· Node-RED Â· iptables/iproute2 Â· Modbus Â· REST API

    Integration/automation around Techem in Home Assistant.

## How I work

-   Focus on **documentation**, simple scripts, and safe defaults (no secrets in repos).  
-   Code and READMEs are often **language-polished with AI** â€“ all changes are reviewed and tested manually.
