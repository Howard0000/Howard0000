# Hi! I’m Håvard (Howard0000) 👋  
[:norway: Norwegian version](README.md)

Project manager in the construction industry by day – developer and problem solver in my spare time.  
I like working in small, safe steps: frequent commits, well-documented code, and solutions that actually work in real-world setups.

💡 **Focus areas:**  
- Smart home systems (Home Assistant, integrations, automations)  
- Networking and infrastructure (Raspberry Pi, VPN, Pi-hole, UniFi)  
- Integrations with APIs and third-party hardware  
- Documentation and sharing projects so others can reuse and build on them  

🔧 **Technologies I frequently use:**  
Python · YAML · Docker · Node-RED · iptables/iproute2 · Modbus · REST APIs  

## Featured projects

- **[home-assistant-sikom](https://github.com/Howard0000/home-assistant-sikom)**  
  A modern HACS integration for Sikom, offering simple UI-based configuration, automatic device discovery, and support for thermostats, switches, AMS meters, and Easee chargers.

- **[Home Assistant – Systemair Modbus (SAVE)](https://github.com/Howard0000/home-assistant-systemair-modbus)**  
  A Home Assistant integration for Systemair SAVE air handling units with Modbus TCP support.  
  Provides structured monitoring and control of the ventilation system, with a focus on correct airflow, energy-efficient operation, and stable entity handling.

- **[raspberrypi-nordvpn-gateway](https://github.com/Howard0000/raspberrypi-nordvpn-gateway)**  
  Pi-hole + NordVPN (NordLynx) with selective routing using `iptables`, and robust startup handling via `systemd`. Norwegian and English README included.

- **[home-assistant-norsk-tidevann](https://github.com/Howard0000/home-assistant-norsk-tidevann)**  
  Sensors and visual dashboards for Norwegian tidal data in Home Assistant (Kartverket + ApexCharts).

## Recommended projects

- **[ha-techem by @andreas-bertelsen](https://github.com/andreas-bertelsen/ha-techem)**  
  Home Assistant integration and automation around Techem systems.

## How I work

- Strong focus on **documentation**, simple scripts, and safe defaults (no secrets stored in repositories).  
- Code and README files are often **reviewed and polished with the help of AI** — all changes are manually reviewed and tested.
